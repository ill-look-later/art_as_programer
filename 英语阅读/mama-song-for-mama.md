# song for mama

​Mama（IL DIVO）
---


​Mama thank you for who I am 

​Thank you for all the things I'm not

​Forgive me for the words unsaid For the times I forgot

Mama remember all my life 

You showed me love, you sacrificed 

​Think of those young and early days
​ 
How I've changed along the way
​
And I know you believed And I know you had dreams 
​
And I'm sorry it took all this time to see 
​
That I am where I am because of your truth 

And I miss you, And I miss you
