# fath i known for sure

1. We Are Responsible for Our Life. And nobody else. Although all success requires the assistance and cooperation of others, our success can never be left to anyone else. Luck is not a strategy.

> 我们要对我们的人生负责。这不是别人的责任。尽管所有的成功都需要别人的帮助与合作，但我们的成功不能依赖别人来替我们取得。等待好运降临并非上策。


2. You Can't Learn Less. We can only add to our knowledge. We don't have to give some of it up in exchange for new knowledge. Our ability to absorb and retain knowledge may just be unlimited.

> 知识只会越学越多。我们只会增加我们的知识。我们不用放弃一些知识来交换新的知识。我们吸收和掌握知识的能力很可能是无限的。

4. What You Sow, You Reap. This is also called The Law of the Farm or The Law of Reciprocity. In order to continue to receive, we must give.

> 种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。这叫农场定律，也叫回报定律。如果你想继续获得，你就要学会付 出。

5. You Can't Un-ring a Bell. No one can change what's already happened. Whatever is done is done. It's up to us whether we use the experience to learn or allow ourselves to be run by the experience.

> 覆水难收。事情既已发生，谁也无法改变。木已成舟，夫复奈何？我们是从事情中吸取教训，还是一直为其所困，这些都取决于我们自己。

6. It Takes a Long Time to Build a Good Reputation and Only a Short While to Ruin It. Trust and credibility is built slowly but can be lost almost instantly.

> 信誉建难毁易。信任和声誉是慢慢建立起来的 ，但却能毁于一旦。

7. If You Don't Believe in Yourself, No One Else Will. People don't respect or follow anyone who doesn't have confidence in themselves. I think the Universe tends to trust us to the degree we trust ourselves.

> 如果你不相信自己，没有人会相信你。人们是不会尊重或者追随那些没有自信的人的。我认为，你有多自信，世界就有多相信你。

8. We Can Accomplish Anything We Want, Just Not EVERYTHING We Want. It's a too big world. There are too many options, too many things and only a certain amount of time.

> 我们能够完成任何我们想做的事情，但不是所有的事情。世界这么大，有太多的选择，太多的事情，而我们只有有限的时间。想知道卡卡老师的发音秘诀?关注公众号Kakaketang_Jessica 添加助教Kaka_Bruce获取更多免费课程
